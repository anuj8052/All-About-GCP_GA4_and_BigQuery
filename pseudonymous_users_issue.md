**ok, but now my event_intraday table is not in my bigquery dataset and a new pseudonymous_users_20250216 table is there so how to get back my event_intraday table***


It appears that your `event_intraday_*` table has been replaced by a `pseudonymous_users_*` table in your BigQuery dataset. This change is likely due to the activation of the **User Data Export** feature in your GA4 property, which exports user-level data to BigQuery. The `pseudonymous_users_*` table contains data for users who are not identified by a user ID, while the `users_*` table contains data for users identified by a user ID. citeturn0search0

**To restore the `event_intraday_*` table**, follow these steps:

1. **Verify User Data Export Settings**:
   - In your GA4 property, navigate to **Admin** > **BigQuery Links**.
   - Select your existing BigQuery link configuration.
   - Under **User Data**, check if the **Daily** export type is enabled. If it's enabled, the `pseudonymous_users_*` table is created. citeturn0search0

2. **Disable User Data Export (if necessary)**:
   - If you do not require the `pseudonymous_users_*` table, you can disable the User Data export.
   - In the BigQuery Links configuration, uncheck the **User Data** export option.
   - Save the changes.

3. **Confirm the Restoration of `event_intraday_*` Table**:
   - After disabling the User Data export, the `event_intraday_*` table should reappear in your BigQuery dataset.
   - If the table does not reappear, ensure that the **Daily** export type is enabled in the BigQuery Links configuration.

**Important Considerations**:

- **Data Availability**: The `event_intraday_*` table contains near-real-time event data, while the `pseudonymous_users_*` table contains user-level data. Disabling the User Data export will stop the creation of the `pseudonymous_users_*` table but will not affect the `event_intraday_*` table.

- **Data Privacy**: The `pseudonymous_users_*` table is part of GA4's efforts to handle user data in a privacy-conscious manner. If you disable this export, ensure that your data handling practices comply with relevant privacy regulations.
